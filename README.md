# Task_Reminder
Task Reminder is a Python script that reads an Excel file with tasks and their scheduled times and sends notifications before the task is due. It can be run manually or scheduled to run automatically at specific times with Windows Task Scheduler. This helps to remind about the tasks and not to miss anything important.
